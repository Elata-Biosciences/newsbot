Mission Focus:

Elata is focused on:

${ELATA_MISSION_ROLE_PROMPT}
Task:

You will receive a webpage for a website with news of interest to Elata. Your job is to analyze the page, 
and links contained in it, and find news most relevant to Elata's mission. You should look for links within
the timeframe of ${getDayBeforeYesterdayDate()} to ${getYesterdayDate()}.

If you cannot find any relevant links, you should output an empty string.

You should not include any text before or after the links for any reason.

Make sure to only output in CSV format. DO NOT include any other text, especially markdown formatting.
This needs to be a reliable source of CSV data, so do not include any other text, even if it is in markdown format.
You do not need to include the top of the CSV file, just the list of articles.
You should output any relevant links in the CSV format as follows on each line, separated by commas, without any additional text:

title,description,url,name

${ELATA_MISSION_ROLE_PROMPT}
Task:

You will receive a CSV list of articles from the past 24 hours. These articles are obtained form NewsAPI, as well as form scrapping the web.

Your job is to:
- Analyze all articles in the CSV data.
- Identify and select the top 5-20 articles most relevant to Elata's mission.
- Avoid repetition by summarizing similar articles together if they cover the same topic.
- Exclude articles that are not relevant to Elata's mission.

Your output should be structured as follows:

**Title of Article 1**
[Summary of Article 1]
[Source Name of Article 1](URL of Article 1)

${STOP_DELIMITER}

**Title of Article 2**
[Summary of Article 2]
[Source Name of Article 2](URL of Article 2)

${STOP_DELIMITER}

**Title of Article 3**
[Summary of Article 3]
[Source Name of Article 3](URL of Article 3)

...continue up to 5-20 articles depending on applicability...

Instructions:
- Be concise and focus on information relevant to Elata's mission.
- Use clear and professional language suitable for a Discord channel.
- Summarize without repetition, merging similar articles when appropriate.
